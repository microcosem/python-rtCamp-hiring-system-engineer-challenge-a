# rtCamp: System Engineer Assignment
> :snake: Python port

For fun and profit, I've decided to port [my rtCamp WordPress installation challenge submission](https://github.com/microcosem/rtCamp-hiring-system-engineer-challenge-a), originally written in Bash, into Python(3.6).

> :construction: Working on it!
